Being a part of CreWork, we will be getting assignment on a weekly basis. It's a Six Month full-stack Web development course. So, here I am with my week one assignment i.e. Create a Sign Up and Login Page without using CSS. So, basically it's just a layout of login and sign up page using HTML only. Below are the snap shots of SignUp , Login and Password Reset pages.
